# Require `Strict-Transport-Security` response header (`strict-transport-security`)

`strict-transport-security` warns against serving resources over
HTTPS without `strict-transport-security` header and validates the
header directives and their corresponding values.

## Why is this important?

Web security has been a crutial concern for the developers nowadays.
Unlike [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] and [SQL injection][sql
injection], the exploit of insufficient protection over the transport
layer can be harder to picture in practice. If a website accepts
a connection through HTTP and then redirects to HTTPS, it opens up
opportunites for a "man-in-the-middle" attack, when the redirect could
be exploited and lead the user to a malicious site.

By specifying the `Strict-Transport-Security` header along with a
`max-age` value in the reponse, a website is able to declare themselves
to be only accessible via the secure connections within the specified
time period. So for future attempts to the same domain via the insecure
connections, the browswer knows that it should never load the site using
HTTP and automatically convert all attempts to HTTPS requests instead.

Notably, to prevent the `Strict-Transport-Security` header from being
stripped by the attacker on the user's first visit, major browsers
include a "pre-loaded" list of sites that must be loaded via HTTPS.
You can submit your domain name in the [online form][preload form] to
be included in the list. After being included, browsers will never be
able to connect to your domain using an insecure connection. So use
with great caution: Before you decide to have your own domain included,
make sure that you are able to support HTTPS for all the subdomains
and will never again need the insecure scheme.

## What does the rule check?

For a site served over HTTPS, this rule checks the following:

* If it has a `Strict-Transport-Security` header.
* If the header has the required `max-age` directive.
* If the `max-age` directive has a value that is longer than
  18 weeks (10886400s).
* If `Strict-Transport-Security` header has repetitive directives.
* When a `Strict-Transport-Security` header contains `preload`
  directive, this rule.

will first check the domain name against the [HTTP Strict Transport
Security (HSTS) preload list][preload list] for the preload status,
and then check whether this domain has errors that would prevent
preloading by calling the hstspreload api endpoint. This check is
disabled by default.

### Examples that **trigger** the rule

`Strict-Transport-Security` response header was not sent over `HTTPS`:

```text
HTTP/... 200 OK

...
```

`Strict-Transport-Security` response header is sent with a `max-age`
value that is too short:

```text
HTTP/... 200 OK

...
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=1
```

`Strict-Transport-Security` response header is sent without `max-age`
directive:

```text
HTTP/... 200 OK

...
Strict-Transport-Security: maxage=31536000
```

`Strict-Transport-Security` response header is sent with duplicate
`includeSubDomains` directives:

```text
HTTP/... 200 OK

...
Strict-Transport-Security: includeSubDomains; max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

### Examples that **pass** the rule

```text
HTTP/... 200 OK

...
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
```

```text
HTTP/... 200 OK

...
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

```text
HTTP/... 200 OK

...
 Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

## Can the rule be configured?

Yes, you can configure the value that `max-age` is checked against
with. By default, this limit is set as 18 weeks (10886400s);

E.g. The following configuration will change the `max-age` value
limit to `123456`.

```json
"strict-transport-security": ["error", {
    "minMaxAgeValue": 123456
}]
```

Also, you can configure the rule so that if `preload` directive is
included in the header, it will check whether this domain has errors
that would prevent preloading by calling the hstspreload api endpoint.
This validation is disabled by default.

E.g. The following configuration will enable the `preload` validation.

```json
"strict-transport-security": ["error", {
    "checkPreload": true
}]
```
