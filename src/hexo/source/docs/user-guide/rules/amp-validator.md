# AMP HTML Validator (`amp-validator`)

> AMP HTML is a way to build web pages that render with reliable and
fast performance. It is our attempt at fixing what many perceive as
painfully slow page load times – especially when reading content on
the mobile web. AMP HTML is built on existing web technologies; an
AMP page will load (quickly) in any modern browser.

***From [AMPProject - AMP HTML][ampproject]***

## Why is this important?

If you are building an AMP page, you need to make sure the HTML is valid.
Only valid AMP content can be added to an [AMP Cache][amp-cache].

## What does the rule check?

This rule uses [amphtml-validator][amphtml-validator] to validate the
HTML of your page.

## Can the rule be configured?

Yes, you can decide if you want to receive errors only or
also warnings found by [amphtml-validator][amphtml-validator]. By default
all warnings and errors are reported. If you prefer to see only the errors
use the following configuration:

```json
"amp-validator": ["error", {
    "errorsOnly": true
}]
```
