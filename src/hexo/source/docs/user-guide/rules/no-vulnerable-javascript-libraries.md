# No vulnerable libraries (`no-vulnerable-javascript-libraries`)

This rules uses Snyk's [Vulnerability DB][snykdb] to identify if
a website is running a vulnerable client-side JavaScript library
or framework.

## Why is this important?

Making sure your website dependencies are free of known vulnerabilities
is important, as among other things, that could allow a malicious person
to take advantage of one of them to create a [Cross-site Scripting][XSS]
attack and steal private information.

## What does the rule check?

This rules uses Snyk's [Vulnerability DB][snykdb] and
[js-library-detector][js-library-detector] to check if the
website is running a vulnerable version of a client-side JavaScript
library or framework.

The vulnerability database is updated automatically from [Snyk][snykdb]
if the cached content is older than 24h.

## Can the rule be configured?

You can configure the minimum severity to report:

```json
{
    "no-vulnerable-libraries": ["error", {
        "severity": "low|medium|high"
    }]
}
```

The `severity` possible values are: `low` (default), `medium`,
and `high`.

If you configure this rule to `high`, and `sonar` only finds
`low` or `medium` vulnerabilities, no issues will be raised.
